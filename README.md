# 2.	Project Topic
The project topic falls under the Text Classification Competition option. 

The main goals of this project:
1.	To explore sentiment analysis using a state-of-the-art method
2.	To beat the baseline score using the given training and sample datasets

# 3.	Sentiment Classifier using BERT
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a state-of-the-art pre-training Natural Language Processing (NLP) model developed by Google. In this project, sentiment analysis uses BERT to detect sarcasm in Twitter tweets.

# 4.	Programming Language
The project uses Python 3.8 programming language to implement software code.

# 5. Previous Experience with BERT
I have no previous experience with BERT nor with Deep Learning.
I have a little experience with the Python programming language and the Pandas library.

# 6. Important File(s)
